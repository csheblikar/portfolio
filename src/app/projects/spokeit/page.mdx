*SpokeIt* is a speech therapy game built in Unity, designed to support children aged 4-8 with orofacial cleft palate in improving their pronunciation. Originally developed in Swift for iOS, I led the complete migration to Unity to expand platform support and enhance scalability. The game integrates real-time speech recognition, interactive mini-games, and a gentle, story-driven interface to keep young users engaged throughout their learning journey.

This project was developed in collaboration with a multidisciplinary research team at Northern Arizona University and is being tested for both usability and therapeutic impact.
