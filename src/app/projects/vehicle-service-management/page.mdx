Vehicle Service Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of automobile service appointments, customer records, and maintenance history. Developed as a full-stack project using the LAMP stack, it provides service centers with an intuitive dashboard to track and manage vehicle servicing more efficiently.

This project was built to simplify workflows for mechanics, front-desk staff, and customersâ€”replacing paper-based logs with a centralized digital system.
