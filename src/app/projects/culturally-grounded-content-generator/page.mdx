This project explored how AI-powered educational platforms can be redesigned to better serve culturally diverse users, especially Indigenous communities. As part of a research initiative at NAU, I led a usability-focused design process that included heuristic evaluations, participatory design sessions, and high-fidelity prototyping using Figma.

Our goal was to address gaps in accessibility and cultural responsiveness by redesigning chat-based educational tools. The result was a more intuitive, collaborative, and inclusive platform tailored to the needs of real users.
