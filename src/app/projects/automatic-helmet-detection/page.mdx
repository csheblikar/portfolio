This project is a real-time computer vision system built to promote road safety by detecting helmet usage among motorcycle riders and extracting vehicle license plate information. Developed as part of an academic project, it processes live video feeds to automatically identify safety violations and log vehicle details for enforcement purposes.

The system uses two lightweight, optimized deep learning models: **YOLOv5** for helmet detection and **MobileNet-SSD** for license plate localization, ensuring fast and accurate performance suitable for real-time applications.
