*OpenAI Subtitle Generator* is a lightweight command-line tool built in Python to generate subtitle (.srt) files from spoken audio in video files. Designed to streamline the subtitle creation process for researchers and content creators, it transcribes audio with high accuracy and formats the output into time-stamped subtitles ready for direct use in media players or editing software.

This tool was especially helpful in supporting research video analysis for behavioral studies and accessibility testing.
