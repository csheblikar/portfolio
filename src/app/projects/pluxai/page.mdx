*PluxAI* is an enterprise Android application designed to manage employee attendance, leave requests, and real-time reporting for HR teams. Built during my internship at SecqurAIse Technologies, I led the Android development process from ideation to Play Store deployment within just 3 months.

The app features seamless cloud sync, offline-first architecture, and a clean UI for both employees and administrators, helping streamline organizational workflows.
