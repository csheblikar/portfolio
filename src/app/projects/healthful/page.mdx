*Healthful* is an Android app designed to provide quick, accessible health predictions based on user-reported symptoms. Built using Java and XML, the app uses a rule-based symptom-matching algorithm to suggest potential conditions and recommend nearby healthcare facilities.

The motivation behind Healthful was to support proactive care in areas with limited medical access. Whether users need a quick sense-check or directions to the closest clinic, Healthful makes it easier to take the next step.
